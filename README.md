# TherapistFitter
Machine learning model that predicts a therapist's treatment approach from their writing style.



Created database after designating the key data available on GoodTherapy.org and PsychologyToday.com. Both had very similar data with some different naming conventions. Certain features (issues, specialties, communities, groups, modalities, services) had several spelling variations on values so I reviewed these features and consolidated them to eliminate/reduce redundancy. I also engineered a new feature of **core_orientation** in which I used domain expertise and supplemental research to in order to group treatment approaches and types of therapy into parent classes. The commonly identified primary therapeutic orientations are Psycho-dynamic, Cognitive Behavioral, Interpersonal, Somatic,  and Eclectic. TA therapist is designated Eclectic if they have more than 1 of the other core_orientations.
