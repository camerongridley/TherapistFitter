                  From Java software developer, to clinical psychologist, to data scientist. On the surface people assume that these are radical 
                  changes. I've never felt that way. To me they are all endeavors that call for critical and creative thinking to help solve 
                  problems that relate to massive amounts of data. I thrive in such an environment, loving the challenge of not only exploring 
                  the data at hand, but determining which questions will be the most beneficial to ask in order to provide an exceptional outcome. 

                  <p class="card-description">
                  My love of technology and people, as well as extensive experience with both, lend me a unique set of talents that enable me 
                  to quickly adapt and step into almost any role a team needs.  When I am not diving into oceans of data, you'll find me, 
                  camera in hand, exploring Colorado, searching for beautiful landscapes and architecture to photograph.  I also enjoy playing 
                  guitar, golfing and riding my bike.
